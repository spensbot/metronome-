# Metronome+

It's a metronome, but better?

IDK. It might not turn into anything seriously useful.

It's mostly just an opportunity for me to have fun messing around with the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API#web_audio_api_target_audience) and [Web MIDI API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_MIDI_API)!

The next step is to read this [Perfect Timing And Latency](https://webaudioapi.com/book/Web_Audio_API_Boris_Smus_html/ch02.html#:~:text=Sounds%20can%20be%20scheduled%20to,currentTime%20%2C%20it%20is%20played%20immediately.) doc
